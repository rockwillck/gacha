# The World's Simplest Gacha
A criticism of gacha games.
## Gacha, the Genre
Gacha games are games that involve lootbox-like mechanics and involve spending in-game and real life currency to effectively gamble on videogame items or characters.  
Some notable gacha games include Genshin Impact and Raid: Shadow Legends.  
These games can be polished, full experiences - gacha games aren't necessarily gambling disguised as a game. They can be real games.  
But the problem with gacha games is the gacha mechanic. It's addictive, dangerous, and rarely and lightly regulated. It's a way for children to get hooked on gambling - and that's never a good thing.
## The Demo
This project is a quick, dead simple showcase of popular gacha mechanics.  
- Pity draws: after a certain number of draws, the game automatically gives you a good outcome to keep you hooked.
- Early luck: the game gives you higher chances when you start to get you hooked in the first place.
- Effects: screen shake, clickiness, and rolling counters all create a dopamine-inducing experience.
- Exaggeration: even though you aren't doing anything, the game acts as if you've accomplished something. In this case, the counter ticks up automatically, but everytime your ones digit changes, the number pops.
